**Step 4**

- Add the location of where you want to install Lua by pressing *New*, in my case I will install it in `C:/Program Files/lua` so I will write that at the new text box.

**Step 5**

- Exit out of all the windows by pressing **OK** (don't exit out by X otherwise it won't save).

**Step 6**

- Download the Lua rar file which can be found [here](https://github.com/Exunys/Lua-5.1/releases/tag/lua).

**Step 7**

- Open the location of choice (mine is `C:/Program Files`) and put the Lua rar file there and extract it. You should be left with a folder named `lua` inside, **do not rename it**, otherwise you will need to change the variable which Lua was saved under in the system environment variables.

**Step 8**

- You're done! This is a bonus step just to run some tests but you don't have to if you don't want to.
- Open the command prompt and type `lua`. If your command prompt looks like the picture below then you're good and you can run some experiments to see if everything is working fine.
